In a [previous post](../keyboard-k380/), I described a way to configure page up, down, home and end on the Logitech K380 keyboard when used with macOS and Logi Options. Years have passed since then, and a helpful comment on the previous page from Bob C pointed out that the newer Logi Options+ made it much easier to configure these keys. So, if you're facing this problem in 2025, you might want to give this a try instead.

Start by [downloading Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/software/logi-options-plus.html) from the Logitech website. Once you've installed it, set up your K380 as normal. When setting the configurable function keys on the keyboard you can now pick options including home, end, page up or page down without requiring keypresses on another keyboard or editing configuration files by hand.

Thanks for the tip, Bob C!
