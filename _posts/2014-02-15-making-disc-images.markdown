Was creating some ISO disc images this week with OS X Lion (from existing discs) and thought I would document the process.

Making an ISO
=============

Using Disk Utility:

 1. Start Disk Utility
 1. Insert the disc you want to create an image from
 1. Select the disc in the sidebar of Disk Utility (in my case, I selected the volume itself and not the drive)
 1. Choose File->New Disk Image From 'VolumeNameHere'
 1. Select DVD/CD master from the Image Format dropdown
 1. Click Save and wait
 1. Finally, rename the .cdr file that's produced to .iso.
 1. Done!
